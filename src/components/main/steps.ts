    description: `I am a full stack web developer. I have an experience working with MSSQL, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL databases. I also have an experience of administrating MSSQL and Oracle databases. I can create and manage database, set up its purging and backup automatic routines. Speaking of my .net experience I can suggest my ability to set up REST backend C# controller using classic .net framework or .net core one. I have an experience developing Windows (.net framework 4.0) and Linux services (.net core). My frontend skills are about developing web-sites using React framework with Typescript template. It might be separate client app or a complex solution (default .net core react-redux template) using domain authentication.`
